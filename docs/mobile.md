When you open the mobile app for the first time, you will see the below screen which allows you to connect the mobile app to your self-hosted web application.

You just need to enter the URL of your self-hosted InvoiceShelf Web Application, example: `https://example.invoiceshelf.com`

That's it! Just click on Save and you are all set to login into InvoiceShelf using your credentials.
